# Machine Learning in Astronomy 
- collaborative learning course to teach ourselves methods in the book `Statistics, Data Mining and Machine Learning in Astronomy` : _collaborative_ success requires some organizational overhead 
## Introductions : 
    - Rahul Biswas (day 1, (contact, background, computation language, collaborative experience, personal goals for the course))
    - Student introductions (current research/research interests/ interest in course topic, computational languages,  and personal goals) 
## Course Goals :
- Teach ourselves the methods in the book, the contexts in which they are used and be able to apply them to 'some' example data sets.
- Think about how it could help us in our work,  and apply it to an astronomy problem 

### How with the course goals be achieved:
- read appropriate book chapters for the class before class (discussion)
- discuss in class (share leading lecture/discussion by rotation)
- Make figures in book in Hands On sessions (These have been done before: eg. [by Gully](https://github.com/gully/astroMLfigs) (this requires python, collaboration would find git useful)
    - How to work with git
- Detailed project on a particular Astronomy topic.

## Today's discussion
- Tools: python git datasets
    - python book (scipy, numpy, sklearn, astroML)
        - use pandas, astropy
        - seaborn, holoviews, 
        - use tensorflow Keras (image based studies) for NN based studies
        - Maybe add to an environment before hands on sessions 
    - git
        - Why ? version control basics ? Figures. Signup

        - use github with jupyter notebooks (problematic) 
        - [starting guide](../../doc/useful_resources.md)


- What does the course cover ? Extracting knowledge from data.
    - multivariate statistics, fitting, regression and non-parametric methods
    - data mining methods
    - machine learning
