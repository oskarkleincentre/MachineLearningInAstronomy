# Resources for the class
## Text Book : `Statistics, Data Mining and Machine Learning AstroML`
- [book chapters from SU Library](http://sfxeu11.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/sfxsub?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&ctx_enc=info:ofi/enc:UTF-8&rfr_id=info:sid/sfxit.com:opac_856&url_ctx_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&sfx.ignore_date_threshold=1&rft.object_id=2550000001192386&svc_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:sch_svc&) Clicking the `Full text via EBook Central`  link on that page will let you navigate to download links for individual chapters (after authentication if outside SU). 
- [astroml website with example code](http://www.astroml.org/) : supplementary material in the book. The codes are publicly available on [github](https://github.com/astroML/astroML) which you can even modify and update if you have a suggested improvement. 
- [repository by Gully Santiago reproducing the figures](https://github.com/gully/astroMLfigs) This is one of the items planned for hands on sessions. So here is (hopefully for inspiration) another person's self motivated attempt to do the same.
